# MD5 to UUID challenge

What a headache!
The russians hacked our database and they encoded the UUID of the clients using an MD5 hashing algorithm!
We made a list of all the possible UUID based on the timestamp we created the users but the list is too huge so
that can't be done by hand. We need someone who can look for the right UUID for every client we have in `clients.csv` using the `possible_uuids.txt`!

We need you to generate a new CSV file adding the column `uuid` to the new CSV containing the UUID of the client.
Are you the one who will make our customers recover their confidence in us?
