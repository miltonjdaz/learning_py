Milton D'az Cover Letter

Job Title -- Company Name

I am interested in the position of ___________ at __________ because I believe I have a valuable skill set to add to the team. I am a 2nd Generation Salvadoran immigrant with parents who came to the United States a few months before I was born. I am currently a Business Analytics Master's student at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (Spring 2020 Graduation) and am learning fundamental data skills in Python and SQL.

My most recent extra-curricular project, which is in it's smallest baby-steps, is called Pocket Analytics. My brother and I are working on building a product to sell to companies who have data but are not ready to hire a full-time BI Developer or Data Analyst. The product is built by combining social media, spreadsheets generated by the business, and Google Analytics data in an Aurora relational database. This database can then be queried by a mobile Tableau app, which gives customers a mobile, one-stop, view of their business's performance. Our selling tag-line is, "You have the world's data at your fingertips, why not your business's?"

Most of my past experience lies outside of technology and data. I have a Bachelor's of Science degree in Education with an emphasis on Social Science. I was a high school history teacher for a semester before making the pivot to data. I retain my passion for story-telling and the complexity of human behavior. I also have a self-starter's spirit by balloon twisting at events since I was in high school. My business has operated at 90%+ profit margin and I am consistently staying up to date to cultural norms for what children may ask for.

I believe that my passion for taking on new data tech learning challenges and my transferable skills; communication, entrepreneurship, etc. outside of tech, make me a promising candidate for the position of ________ at ________. I believe ________company name______ would benefit from my unique background because of my background in Social Studies and entrepreneurship, I take human dynamics and business needs as a baseline for technology. I am excited to possibly contribute to the work that _____Company Name____ does in _____type of work they do (i.e. building software tools for entrepreneurs)_______. I would be happy to move forward in discussing my candidacy for this role! Thank you for your time.
